# Machine-Learning--Celebal-Technologies
Contains machine learning models which does predictions based on data for two business problems.

#Question 1:

Problem Statement: 

The client wants to understand how much Fuel Consumption of a car model affects its Carbon Dioxide Emission in order to make sustainable products in the future.
Train a Simple Linear Regression Model from scratch in NumPy to predict Carbon Dioxide Emissions for a
given amount of Fuel Consumption of a car model and visualize the results.

Solution: Linear Regression model which predicts CO2 emissions for a car model for a given amount of fuel consumption. Accuracy of the model is 80%.

#Question 2:

Problem Statement: 

The client wants to develop a solution that can assist banks to predict customers who 
are most likely subject to churn and reduce this churn rate by recommending benefit plans.
